For drawing we need 3 components :
	1. Geometry
		Contains all the vertices and faces of a 3D shape

	2. Material
		Describes the color and texture of a shape. Colors are described as hexes (same as CSS)

	3. Mesh
		Takes geometry and material and puts them together for rendering.

When a Mesh is ready, it can be added to the scene with "scene.add( shape );"

By default, the shape is added at the origin of the scene (0,0,0). In a fresh scene, that is where the camera is located, so
the shape and the camera overlap and we don't see anything. So the camera has to be moved further out, so the shape is in the
visible frustum. 

	example : camera.position.z = camera.position.z - 10;
